**👋 About Me**
--

I’m a Data Analyst with 9+ years of experience working in high-volume, data-intensive environments, specialising in SQL-led analytics, reporting optimisation, and performance monitoring within regulated systems.

My background began in backend development (VB.NET & SQL Server), where I built and supported database-driven applications. Over time, my focus evolved toward structured analysis, KPI reporting, and translating complex datasets into clear, actionable business insights. 

Alongside strong SQL expertise, I’m expanding my applied analytics capability through hands-on projects in:

- Machine learning & predictive modelling

- NLP & topic modelling

- Time-series forecasting

- LLM-based text analysis

- Model evaluation & interpretability

My work focuses on practical, explainable solutions that improve decision-making and operational performance.
