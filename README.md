## 📌 Featured Project  
### 🎓 **Student Dropout Prediction — Multi-Stage Machine Learning System**  
An end-to-end ML project predicting student progression outcomes using demographic, attendance, and academic performance data across three stages.

**What I built:**  
- A full preprocessing pipeline (encoding, feature engineering, missing value strategy, scaling)  
- Multi-model experimentation using **XGBoost** and **Neural Networks**  
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and KerasTuner  
- Stage-wise comparison (early-stage vs mid-stage vs late-stage prediction)  
- Achieved **97%+ accuracy and AUC ~0.99** in Stage 3  
- Loss curves, feature importance, and evaluation summaries  

**Tech Stack:** Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost, Matplotlib
